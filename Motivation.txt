Title of Project: Real Estate Portal
Systenm Analysis & Design

Our motivation behind the “Real Estate Portal” - the project was - we wanted a portal to give an existing property
company an online home where buyers and sellers will be able to view, buy and sell properties legally while being
satisfied by accessing all the online services from the comfort of their home.
To get rid of the traditional offline annoyance of property hunt as well as to reach out to more prospective consumers
by the use of digital portals, which provide a quick and easy approach for those who have recently moved to a new
location and do not have access to local publishing yet (especially during the ongoing COVID-19 lockdown or
pandemic). This eliminates the need for repeated phone calls and trips to the property's location.
Moreover, the existing systems are very simplistic, as they only give basic property information and detail, with no
assurance or guarantee of a successful commercial transaction whereas our system includes 3D tours, interactive
image galleries as part of the portal's media exploration, property sorting, wishlisting, portal language selection, AD
package subscription, integrated loan calculator and verified agent service.
In short, to introduce new features in the field of online real estate portals and to eradicate all the popular dilemmas
and insecurities of online property transactions at the commercial level as well as to present a safe and valid way of
carrying out online property business we chose the project “Real Estate Portal”.
